# Class-25
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the class 25 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It is the second stage of the angry birds game. It has everything same as the repository 'Class-24' but the sprites are given its pictures and the code is made clear using inheritence. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
